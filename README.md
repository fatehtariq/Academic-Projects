# Artificial Neural Networks
# Semester Project - Handwritten Digits Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

The main goal is to construct and train an artificial neural network on thousands of images of
handwritten digits so that it may successfully identify others when presented. The data that
will be incorporated is the MNIST database which contains 60,000 images for training and
10,000 test images with the help of Keras Python API with TensorFlow as the backend.
Most Handwritten Classification Models depend on a Linear Model in which the matrix data
is first converted into a fixed length vector and then passed on into the Neural Network.
However a better approach would be to use a Convolutional Neural Network and use various
kernels to extract the features.
